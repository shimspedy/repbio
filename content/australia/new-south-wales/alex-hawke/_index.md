Alex Hawke was elected to Federal Parliament on 24 November 2007 as the Member for Mitchell, an electorate centred in the Hills Shire in Northwest Sydney.

Alex was the former Cabinet Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural Affairs. Like so many Australians, Alex’s family came to Australia seeking the opportunity, freedom and safety our beautiful country affords everyone. Australia’s great migration story will continue to be an essential part of our ongoing prosperity, success and recovery.

Prior to this role Alex has served as Assistant Defence Minister and Minister for International Development and the Pacific, Special Minister of State, Assistant Minister for Home Affairs, the Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, and the Assistant Minister to the Treasurer.

Alex is currently the Deputy Chair of Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Service. He has previously served in a number of parliamentary positions and on a number of committees including, as Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters.

The Mitchell electorate is changing rapidly, with many young families moving into expanding suburbs. The Mitchell community has so many innovative small and medium enterprises and their prosperity continues to be a core priority for the Morrison Government.

Alex is also an advocate for reducing the size and scope of government and the ongoing reduction of red and green tape for small and medium businesses. He continues to fight for more and better infrastructure for the Mitchell community, including social infrastructure like parks and playing fields.

Alex holds a Master of Government and Public Affairs and a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Sydney. He has also served as an Army Reserve Office. He has a deep interest in Australian history and is an avid supporter of the Parramatta Eels rugby league team.

Alex lives in Mitchell with his wife Amelia and their four sons, Jack, Lachlan, Thomas and Jonathan.

#### About Alex


Alexander George Hawke is an Australian politician and member of the Liberal Party, who served as the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural Affairs from 2020 to 2022 under the Morrison government. He represents the electoral division of Mitchell in the Australian House of Representatives, a seat he has held since 2007.

Hawke was born in Wollongong, New South Wales on July 9th, 1977, and grew up with his father after his mother passed away when he was ten. His maternal grandparents migrated from Greece in 1953. He attended Hills Grammar School and Cumberland High School before studying at the University of Sydney, where he received his Bachelor of Arts and Masters in Government and Public Affairs. At the university, he joined the Australian Army Reserve and served as a lieutenant with the 1st/15th Royal New South Wales Lancers for six years.

Hawke began his political career by joining the Liberal Party in 1995 and becoming involved with the NSW Division of the Young Liberal Movement. He served as vice-president in 2001, became president in 2002, and was elected Federal President of the Young Liberal Movement in 2005. Hawke has worked as a political advisor to various politicians, including Ross Cameron MP, Senator Helen Coonan, David Clarke MLC, and Ray Williams MP.

Hawke has held several ministerial positions, including Minister for International Development and the Pacific, Assistant Minister for Defence, and Special Minister of State. He was also the Assistant Minister for Home Affairs in the Second Turnbull Ministry.

In 2007, Hawke was elected as the Member of Parliament for Mitchell, defeating his opponent David Elliott with a margin of 81 votes to 20. Hawke's preselection was not without controversy, with some reports labelling him a "right-wing extremist." Hawke strongly rejected these allegations and stated that he represented the values of his electorate.

Hawke has been known for his factional manipulations within the Liberal Party, and in 2009, he split from the NSW Right faction of the party over disputes with NSW upper house MP David Clarke. He then aligned himself with the NSW Moderates, using his balance of power position on state executive to influence candidate selection.

Overall, Alexander George Hawke has had a successful political career in Australia, holding various positions in government and representing the electorate of Mitchell since 2007.
