Senator Jana Stewart is a proud Mutthi Mutthi and Wamba Wamba woman from North-West Victoria, and a mother to Jude and Ari.

Jana is the youngest First Nations woman to be elected in Federal Parliament, and the first Aboriginal Labor Senator for Victoria.

Jana’s personal and professional life has been shaped by ironclad values. An unwavering commitment to children and families, a firm belief in the power and importance of community, and a deeply held feeling of responsibility to do everything she can to advocate for others.

Jana comes from a long line of strong Aboriginal women, stretching back over sixty thousand years. She is the first in her family to attend university, where she received two degrees to become a family therapist.

From her work at Victorian Aboriginal Child Care Agency and the Child Protection System, all the way to the steps of parliament – Jana has never been afraid to stand up for others.

Jana is committed to ensuring all workers are treated fairly and have a safe workplace and is a dedicated member of the Transport Workers Union.
