Linda White, an Australian politician, was born around 1960 and is a member of the Australian Labor Party (ALP). In the 2022 federal election, she was elected to the Senate as the ALP's lead candidate in Victoria, and her term commenced on 1 July 2022. Prior to her political career, White worked as a lawyer and trade unionist and held the position of assistant national secretary of the Australian Services Union (ASU).

White attended the University of Melbourne, where she studied law and commerce. After working as a solicitor for ten years, she joined the ASU and became its assistant national secretary, where she was responsible for the union's national strategy in various industries, including the private sector, airline industry, IT and call centre industries, and the non-government social and community services sector.

White also served as a director of the Victorian Legal Industry Superannuation Scheme, which later merged into Legalsuper, as well as a director of the Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria and the Australian Centre for the Moving Image.

In 2006, White was elected to the Australian Labor Party National Executive. She was later appointed to the board of the Chifley Research Centre, the party's think tank, in 2013, and became its chair in 2015.

White won ALP preselection as the party's lead Senate candidate in Victoria at the 2022 federal election in March 2022. She is a member of the Labor Left and is considered the de facto successor to Kim Carr on the ticket, having received the support of the United Workers Union in her preselection contest against Josh Bornstein.
