Raffaele "Raff" Ciccone is a politician from Australia who represents the Australian Labor Party and serves as a Senator for Victoria. He became the 100th Senator to represent Victoria on March 6, 2019, following the resignation of Jacinta Collins. Ciccone grew up in the Melbourne suburb of Oakleigh with his parents, who immigrated to Australia from Italy in the 1960s. He received his education at a local Catholic primary school and Salesian College in Chadstone. Ciccone studied arts and commerce at Deakin University and the University of Melbourne and initially worked in financial planning. Later, he moved to industrial relations and employment law, becoming a senior official in the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association (SDA) where he advocated for retail sector workers, including those who had been underpaid by 7-Eleven.

Ciccone joined the Australian Labor Party in 2000, working as a research officer for Senator Jacinta Collins while studying. He later became the vice-president of the Australian Labor Party in Victoria. Ciccone put his name forward for the Senate seat after Senator Collins announced she would not be contesting the seat at the 2019 federal election. In the 46th Parliament of Australia, he served as Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate and was on the Parliament's Joint Standing Committees on Migration and on Treaties, and he became Chair of the Senate Select Committee on Temporary Migration.

Ciccone's political views include advocating for stronger penalties against wage theft, a rise in unemployment benefits, and greater protection of rights for gig workers. He has also been a member of informal cross-party groupings, such as the Wolverines and the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China. He has argued for Australia's agriculture industry to be considered a matter of national security, and he has supported the country's timber industry, arguing that it can help reduce carbon emissions. Ciccone has criticized climate change activists who argue that environmental interests and industry interests are opposed. He has connections to a pro-resources grouping within the Australian Labor Party known as the Otis Group and has argued against the party's opposition to nuclear power in Australia.
