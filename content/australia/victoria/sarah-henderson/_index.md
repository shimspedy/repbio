Sarah Moya Henderson is an Australian politician, lawyer, and former journalist. She was born on 4 April 1964 in Geelong, Victoria, and has been serving as a Senator for Victoria since September 2019, representing the Liberal Party. Before joining the Senate, she held the Division of Corangamite in the House of Representatives from 2013 to 2019. Henderson started her career as a journalist with Channel 7 in Melbourne, and later worked for Channel 9 and Channel 10 before moving to ABC-TV. She has presented several programs, including the consumer advocacy program The Investigators, Australia's Most Wanted, and the Victorian presenter of The 7.30 Report. She was awarded a Walkley Award for her coverage of the Port Arthur massacre. In 1998, she obtained a Bachelor of Laws degree from Monash University and worked as an attorney for News Corporation. She also established the Kudos Management Group, which led to business management roles with Network Ten and National Indigenous Television.

Henderson's political career began in 2009 when she was selected as the Liberal Party candidate for the federal seat of Corangamite. Although she was defeated in the 2010 election, she was reselected as the Liberal Party's candidate for Corangamite at the 2013 federal election and won the seat with a 4.6-point swing. Ahead of the 2019 election, a redistribution erased Henderson's majority and made Corangamite marginally Labor. Henderson sought another term in 2019, but was defeated by her 2016 opponent, Libby Coker. Later that year, she was appointed to the Senate to fill a casual vacancy caused by Victorian Senator Mitch Fifield's resignation. In 2022, she was appointed to Peter Dutton's shadow cabinet as the communications portfolio holder before replacing Alan Tudge in the education portfolio following his retirement from parliament in February 2023.
