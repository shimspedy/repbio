#### About Luke Howarth
Luke was born at the Royal Brisbane Hospital and enjoyed a great childhood in Bracken Ridge. Growing up, you would often find him in a tinnie on Salt Water Creek fishing and mud crabbing with his Dad, or at the Bracken Ridge Scout Hall practising judo.

After a decade of working at Toombul Music and Sony Australia as a sales representative, Luke decided to buy into the family business and became the Managing Director at Sandgate Pest Control. Meanwhile, he met his wife Louise and they had three boys â€“ Will, Tom and Sam. Lukes family is the most important thing in the world to him and they truly are the greatest joy in his life. Recently he added one more to the Howarth clan: Matilda, a Doberman pup.

Luke first decided to run for politics in 2004 for the State Seat of Sandgate. He was frustrated by the blatant lies and union mongering of the Labor Party and wanted to make a real difference for families and businesses in the community he calls home.

In September 2013, Luke was elected to represent the Petrie Electorate in the Australian Parliament.

In July 2016, Luke successfully retained the seat of Petrie in the Federal Election.

In May 2019, Luke retained the seat of Petrie in the Federal Election for his third term in Parliament and was also appointed as Assistant Minister for Community Housing, Homelessness and Community Services.

In December 2020, Luke was appointed as the Assistant Minister for Youth and Employment Services.

In May 2022, Luke retained the seat of Petrie in the Federal Election for his fourth term in Parliament and was also appointed as Shadow Minister for Defence Industry and Shadow Minister for Defence Personnel.

Luke is a member of the North Brisbane Crime Stoppers Board and Police Citizen Youth Club Board. He has tirelessly fought for local programs and infrastructure. He is passionate about the chaplaincy program, helping small businesses get ahead and ensuring our defence force and security agencies have the resources they need to keep Australia safe.  

#### Luke Howarth biograph 

Luke Ronald Howarth, born on 6 June 1972, is an Australian politician who has been a member of the House of Representatives since the 2013 federal election, representing the Division of Petrie. He is a member of the Liberal National Party of Queensland and sits with the Liberal Party in federal parliament.

Early Life and Education
Born and raised in Bracken Ridge, Queensland, Howarth is the son of Ron and Denise Howarth. He has one sister. In 1999, he married his wife Louise, and they have three sons.

Career
After leaving school, Howarth's first job was at Barry Bull's Toombul Music. He later worked as a sales representative at Sony Australia from 1993 to 2001. In 2002, he joined his family's pest control business, working alongside his mother, father, and wife.

Political Career
Howarth joined the Liberal Party at the age of 19. In 2004, he ran as a candidate for the Queensland state election in the electoral district of Sandgate, but was unsuccessful despite a 10% swing in his favor against the incumbent Labor MP Gordon Nuttall.

In the 2013 federal election, Howarth won the seat of Petrie with a 3.04% swing, defeating the sitting ALP member, Yvette D'Ath, who had held the seat since the 2007 federal election. He was reelected in the 2016 federal election with an increased 1.6% margin, and in the 2019 election, the margin increased further to 8.4% in line with other Liberal National Party candidates in Queensland.

In May 2022, Howarth won despite a 3.96% swing against him, becoming the first opposition MP to hold the seat in 35 years.

In August 2018, Howarth played a key role in the leadership spill that removed Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull from his position.

In July 2019, Howarth took on the role of Assistant Minister for Community Housing, Homelessness, and Community Services. He expressed his intention to put a positive spin on homelessness, claiming that the number of rough sleepers had reduced in the area over the past 15 years, despite mixed verdicts on this claim.

From December 2020 until May 2022, Howarth served as the Assistant Minister for Youth and Employment Services. Following the defeat of the Liberal government in the 2022 election, he was appointed as the Shadow Minister for Defence Industry and the Shadow Minister for Defence Personnel.

Howarth is a member of the National Right faction of the Liberal Party.
