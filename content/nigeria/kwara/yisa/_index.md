Born on 14 June 1955, Oyelola Yisa Ashiru is a Nigerian architect, politician, and CEO of Capital Projects Limited, a real estate firm with branches in Lagos, Abuja, and other West African countries. He was elected as a senator to represent Kwara South Senatorial District in the 9th Senate after winning the senatorial election with 89,704 votes, defeating the incumbent Adebayo Rafiu Ibrahim of PDP, who polled 45,175.

Ashiru attended Iyeru okin primary school, Offa, before proceeding to Esie Iludun Anglican Grammar School in 1968. He completed his secondary education at Federal Government College, Sokoto, in 1974 and later studied environmental design and architecture at the University of Lagos, where he graduated in 1980.

Having run for office on multiple occasions, in 2018, Ashiru declared his intention to run as Senator of Kwara South senatorial district in the 2019 Nigerian general election on the political platform of the People's Democratic Party (PDP). In August 2018, PDP members in Kwara State, including Ashiru, decamped to All Progressives Congress (APC) to campaign against the dynasty of Bukola Saraki, who he accused of poorly administering Kwara state previously, for 16 years.

In the APC primary election, Ashiru won the senatorial ticket after defeating Suleiman Ajadi and many others. After his inauguration into the 9th Senate on 11 June 2019, he was appointed the Vice Chairman Senate Committee on Housing and Vice Chairman Senate Committee on Public Procurement on 29 July 2019.

During a campaign tour to Ojoku in the Oyun area of Kwara state on 20 February 2019, Ashiru and his supporters were attacked. The APC alleged that two of its members were shot dead by attackers loyal to the PDP. Ojoku is the hometown of Adebayo Rafiu Ibrahim, who was contesting the Kwara south senatorial seat in the 2019 Nigerian general election. On 22 February 2019, Adebayo Rafiu Ibrahim, the incumbent senator of Kwara South, was arrested in connection to the attack on Ashiru and his supporters.
