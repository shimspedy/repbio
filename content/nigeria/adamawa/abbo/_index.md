Ishaku Elisha Cliff Abbo is a Nigerian politician. He hails from Muchalla Ward, Mubi-North LGA of Adamawa State. He is the senator representing the Adamawa North Senatorial District in Adamawa State at the Nigerian 9th National Assembly.

#### POLITICAL CAREER
On February 23, 2019, Abbo was elected as the Senator representing Adamawa North, having polled 79,337 votes as against the incumbent senator, Binta Masi Garba of the APC.

#### SCANDAL
In June 2019, he was at the center of a viral video scandal, after a CCTV video of him assaulting a nursing woman in a sex shop made rounds on the internet. In defense, Abbo claimed his sister was attacked in the shop, and he only went there to defend her from the abuse she had suffered, and the incident occurred before he was inaugurated as a senator of the federal of Nigeria on June 11, 2019. An explanation which did not tally with the scenes played out in the Video. 

The Inspector General of the Nigeria Police ordered an investigation into the incident after a public outrage. The senate also set up an investigative panel head by Senator Sam Egwu to do a thorough investigation in the incident and report back to the senate within two weeks. At the first sitting of the panel a heated argument ensued between Senators Abbo and Oluremi Tinubu on the method to be adopted.

Abbo had asked the panel to conduct its investigation off the camera since the case was already before a but Senator Tinubu object threatening to recommend the suspension of senator Abbo if he dictates to the panel investigating him. The findings of the panel have not been made public. However, he tendered an apology before his arraignment in the magistrate court for criminal assault where he also pleaded not guilty. Consequently, Abbo was released on bail.
