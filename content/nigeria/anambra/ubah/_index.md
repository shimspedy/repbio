Patrick Ifeanyi Ubah, born on September 3, 1971, is a Nigerian politician, entrepreneur, and businessman who currently serves as a Senator representing Anambra South Senatorial District in the Nigerian Senate. He is also the founder and CEO of Capital Oil (CCO), established in 2001.

Ifeanyi was born as the eldest of seven children to Mr. & Mrs. Alphonsus Ubah in Otolo, a quarter of Nnewi in Anambra State, Nigeria. Due to financial constraints, he dropped out of Premiere Academy, Lugbe, Abuja, and learned a trade at a young age. He has since attended numerous local and international business courses and seminars on leadership and business management.

Ifeanyi started as an exporter of motor tyres and spare parts mainly in West Africa, including Ghana, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and DR Congo before expanding his business ventures in some European countries, including Belgium and the United Kingdom. He founded Capital Oil and Gas Limited in 2001, as well as The Authority Newspaper, a Nigerian daily newspaper, and Ifeanyi Ubah F.C., a football club in the Nigeria Premier League, following its purchase as Gabros International Football Club.

Ifeanyi Ubah contested in the 2014 Anambra gubernatorial election under the platform of the Labour Party but lost. However, in 2019, he contested and won the Anambra South Senatorial elections under the platform of the Young Progressive Party (YPP).

Ifeanyi Ubah is married to Uchenna Ubah, a Business Administration graduate from Ahmadu Bello University in Nigeria, and they have five children together. He also runs the Ifeanyi Ubah Foundation, which is named after him.

In September 2022, gunmen attacked Ifeanyi Ubah's convoy while he was on his way to Nnewi in Enugwu-Ukwu, Anambra State. The attack resulted in the death of at least five people, including two policemen. However, Ubah survived as the vehicle he was riding in was bulletproof.
